        Chuck Norris. The Man. The Myth. The Legend. The actor, author and
        martial artist began acting in the 70s, alongside the likes of Dean
        Martin and Bruce Lee. By 1983 he made a name for himself in Lone
        McQuade, which inspired his later well-known lead role on Walker, Texas
        Ranger. With his expansive filmography, Norris has built a legend out of
        himself. Since the early 2000s, fans have crafted Norris jokes and
        fictional “facts”. They range from boasts about his roundhouse kicks, to
        how he is so powerful even the dark is afraid of him. The key to a
        decent Chuck Norris joke/fact is in its embellishment and sharp
        delivery. They are short and to the point and do not need any basis in
        real information about the actor. The simplicity makes each joke
        memorable and long-lasting. Although it is been years since his last
        acting role, Norris influence lives on as a long-running joke on the
        Internet. In honor of an all-American bad ass, heres 102 Chuck Norris
        jokes and memorable facts.
